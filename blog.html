                <p>
                <p>I always see people online making the joke that buying and reading books are two different hobbies. Firstly, buying books offers so much: the promise of hours of entertainment, the potential for learning, a physical ornamentation to be displayed and shown. Having a full shelf is a nice thing to look at, but if most of your books are unread there is an intangible yet significant thing missing.</p>
                <p>Books stick in your head more than movies or television does. After all, your brain had to construct the images itself, and it’s not going to put all that hard work to waste by forgetting it.</p>
                <p>Read books hold a sort of power. Just by looking at them are they able to elicit memories from forgotten parts of your mind. They have a certain aura. Whatever the overall mood of the book was and whatever emotions it drew out from you hover around it like an invisible mist.</p>
                <p>Crash by J.G. Ballard makes my stomach turn whenever I look at it. The disgusting characters and scenes were uncomfortable to read and yet they were so effective in their purpose. I can still vividly recall the interior of the protagonist’s car, as well as the scars that marred his body.</p>
                <p>Just looking at my copy of Stoner by John Williams can make me sad. Although, it’s the hopeful kind of sad that melts melancholy and joy, breeding a rare and unusual feeling that I thought only came from real life. I remember both the tragedy and happiness in his life as if I had experienced them right beside William Stoner. </p>
                <p>Terry Pratchett wrote in his series Discworld that large collections of books have the ability to bend time and space, creating an area that ignores the rigid rules of the world and instead invents its own reality. I think a large bookshelf of read books has that power. So many memories and feelings all sitting on some block of wood pressed up against your wall.</p>
                <p>Let me confess that I, too, have many, many unread books. My shelf at home doesn’t quite have the time-and-space-bending ability that I have just mentioned. But I never plan to stop reading. And that means that one day my bookshelf will be a Jackson Pollock smattering of memories and emotions. And it will hold a significant power for me.</p>
                <p>…</p>
                <p>Read your books!</p>

                <p>
                    Having my own website means that I have a platform to publicly express my thoughts and share things that are important to me.

                <p>
                    I plan to release opinion pieces, observational (mini) essays, book and film reviews, and any and all thoughts that I think have some value.
                </p>
                <p>I'll see you on Sunday.</p>
