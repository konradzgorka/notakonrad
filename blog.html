                <p>
                    <p>Do art mediums deviate towards film?</p>
                    <p>I’m seeking to ask, not necessarily answer, this question with the hopes of thinking about whether a medium, such as a novels, graphic novels, and video games, are suffering, or not, from trying to be more like film. The basis of this thought stems from reading more contemporary fiction, playing more single player games, and a recent immersion into graphic novels.</p>
                    <p>Contemporary fiction, especially contemporary sci-fi and fantasy, tends (and I use this word loosely as I have read a relatively miniscule amount) to write like scene descriptions. Specifically, there’s a lot of “he did this” and “this happened and then this happened and then she did this.” Which isn’t bad, but it reads more like someone is describing exactly how a scene is playing out instead of character bias and thought helping write the scene. Please note, that this type of writing does work, take The Road by Cormac McCarthy for example. But I wonder if this style of writing would ever be so popular if it weren’t for film.</p>
                    <p>Video games, especially single-player games, sometimes play more like movies with gameplay interspersed than a game with cutscenes in-between. Cutscenes are the driving force for the story, and the game-play sometimes acts as a thread between story beats. For example, usually in a game when you beat a boss, it triggers a cut-scene that doesn’t match the gameplay and the boss escapes or suddenly beats the character even though you easily defeated them. It’s this type of dissonance that can make gameplay feel detached from the story.</p>
                    <p>Graphic novels would, naturally I think, drift towards a film-like approach, as there are a ton of similarities between the two. The most basic graphic novels treat their panels like freeze-frames of a movie, where were it set in motion, would be better than the image. What I think a graphic novel can set out to do, and the great ones do this, is fully appreciate the still image as an art form. Take into the consideration the difference between a photo and a video of a landscape. The stillness and permanence of the photo outdoes the video, almost every time.</p>
                    <p>I would like to say that blending mediums, and borrowing techniques, is most definitely not a bad thing. I think it can be done to great effect. </p>
                    <p>I’m asking whether the tendency to embrace film techniques is limiting the potential for creative and innovative story-telling. I think that if I’m asking myself if this would be better as a movie or show, then perhaps the medium isn’t being fully utilized.</p>
                    <p>This is an idea that I’d like to return to in the future and properly expand upon.</p>

                <p>
                <p>Growing up in the age of DVDs at home meant that I didn’t have an endless supply of movies I could watch at will. Rather, I had a select few that I would play until the disc’s burned out from repeated use. One of those movies was Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s (Philosopher’s) Stone.</p>
                <p>I look back fondly upon that film and I have had the pleasure of recently re-watching it, and I have a few thoughts.</p>
                <p>Firstly, it is just as cozy as I remember. From the Christmas scenes to Hagrid giving Harry the book with the photo of his parents at the end, the movie excels at making the viewer feel warm inside. This is the definitely the most welcoming and easy Harry Potter to watch.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, there is some great filmmaking in this. Captivating cinematography, excellent acting, great set and costume design, and steady pacing all lend themselves to creating a perfect representation of the amazing story and world.</p>
                <p>Despite all of my praise, the film isn’t perfect. The part that aged the worst for me was the special effects. Jumping from the gorgeous and lived-in practical sets to the janky green screen and PS2-looking CGI really breaks the illusion and reminds you that you are watching a movie. But that’s a minor issue for me.</p>
                <p>I feel relieved, in a way, that a movie that I’d watched a million times in my childhood has held up for me as an adult. I wonder what I’ll think of The Master of Disguise… </p>

                <p>
                <p>I’ve only started to cook within the past four years. Before that, besides slapping together sandwiches and pouring cereal, I’d never really done anything close to cooking. It was only until I had to live with roommates that I’d realized the importance of the missing skill that I had been able to avoid using my whole life. I needed to learn how to cook, and thankfully my mom taught me a few recipes that could sustain me while I was away.</p>
                <p>Learning those first few recipes had unlocked a passion within me that I did not know I had. Over the next few years, I watched countless YouTube videos and spent time learning from family and friends. Now, I love to cook (not clean!) and I derive a great joy from it. It’s incredibly rewarding experimenting and learning in the kitchen, and finding things that work. It’s also nice to be able to cook something that excites me for dinner, and just make food that tastes good.</p>
                <p>Cooking for myself is good, but cooking for someone else is great. There’s a level of pressure to please (and maybe even impress) the other person that adds stakes to the cooking. More significantly though, to bring happiness to another person, even if it’s just with a few bites, is incredibly fulfilling and it’s what drives me the most to become a better cook.</p>
                <p>Reflecting upon my young cooking journey has granted me a new lens with which to look on the rest of my life. I’ve learned that there are hidden passions out there for me, waiting to be discovered. As long as I’m open to new ideas and challenges, I can discover new things that keep my life fulfilling and bring me joy.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p>
                <p>I’m just over half way through Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu, and I’d like to start by saying that I like it. I’m really into the story and I’m excited to uncover all of the mysteries that have been laid out in the first half. The book is filled with amazing ideas and it interestingly explores concepts in philosophy and science. What doesn’t excite me are the characters, or the dialogue, or the stiff prose. Those are all major flaws for me, and yet, I’m not bothered by it. I would say the writing of Three-Body Problem is functional. It’s there to get the story across and that’s it. What is happening, and not how it’s told, is what’s driving me to burn through the rest of the book.</p>
                <p>Now take The Sea by John Banville, something like the complete opposite of Three-Body Problem. I think this book is also great, but where Three-Body’s story is elaborate, The Sea’s is simple and small. But The Sea makes up for that with some of the most beautiful writing anyone will ever come across. Its writing is infused with emotion. Sentences are constructed as to wring out the emotions from the characters and splash them onto the reader. It is the language of The Sea that delivers the story.</p>
                <p>I don’t want to say that style or substance should be prioritized over one another, because in literature, the style is part of the substance, and the substance should influence the style. A great book has its prose burrowed with characterization. Details about the story and the characters reveal themselves in the subtleties of the writing. But simultaneously, the story is what should be dictating the nature of the style. </p>
                <p>This blog post has sort of lost itself, but in short, I’m halfway through and I like the book. Read it, if you want. Or don’t.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p>
                <p>I always see people online making the joke that buying and reading books are two different hobbies. Firstly, buying books offers so much: the promise of hours of entertainment, the potential for learning, a physical ornamentation to be displayed and shown. Having a full shelf is a nice thing to look at, but if most of your books are unread there is an intangible yet significant thing missing.</p>
                <p>Books stick in your head more than movies or television does. After all, your brain had to construct the images itself, and it’s not going to put all that hard work to waste by forgetting it.</p>
                <p>Read books hold a sort of power. Just by looking at them are they able to elicit memories from forgotten parts of your mind. They have a certain aura. Whatever the overall mood of the book was and whatever emotions it drew out from you hover around it like an invisible mist.</p>
                <p>Crash by J.G. Ballard makes my stomach turn whenever I look at it. The disgusting characters and scenes were uncomfortable to read and yet they were so effective in their purpose. I can still vividly recall the interior of the protagonist’s car, as well as the scars that marred his body.</p>
                <p>Just looking at my copy of Stoner by John Williams can make me sad. Although, it’s the hopeful kind of sad that melts melancholy and joy, breeding a rare and unusual feeling that I thought only came from real life. I remember both the tragedy and happiness in his life as if I had experienced them right beside William Stoner. </p>
                <p>Terry Pratchett wrote in his series Discworld that large collections of books have the ability to bend time and space, creating an area that ignores the rigid rules of the world and instead invents its own reality. I think a large bookshelf of read books has that power. So many memories and feelings all sitting on some block of wood pressed up against your wall.</p>
                <p>Let me confess that I, too, have many, many unread books. My shelf at home doesn’t quite have the time-and-space-bending ability that I have just mentioned. But I never plan to stop reading. And that means that one day my bookshelf will be a Jackson Pollock smattering of memories and emotions. And it will hold a significant power for me.</p>
                <p>…</p>
                <p>Read your books!</p>
